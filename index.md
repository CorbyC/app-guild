## Lightning Talks
The idea of lightning talks is to give several people the chance to spend 5 to 15 minutes talking about something they want to share. Examples of lightning talk topics:

* I'm working on this 
* I love this 
* I want to know more about this 
* What do you guys think about this? 
* I need some help and advice

## Workshops
Each week I will work on getting some sort of [tutorial or assignment]({{ BASE_PATH }}/workshops) out to the group, whether it is a link to a tutorial, project or something we come up with and one of us creates and posts here. I will work on making sure there is something for the beginner skill level and the intermediate/advanced skill level. If you have suggestions for these assignments [please let me know](https://github.com/vivint-guilds/sord-guild/issues).

## Suggestions and Forums
If you would like to; hear someone speak on a certain subject, suggest a project that we work on as a guild or even make a changes to the guild in someway. Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/vivint-guilds/sord-guild/issues) and tag it appropriately.
